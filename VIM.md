# VIM
NB These are tips I've curated from various sources over a period of time that I find myself using fairly regularly, but not regularly enough for them to stick. It is by no means comprehensive. I attempt to credit those sources where I can.

## Copying, cutting, pasting

#### Copy all

`:%y`

**copy all to clipboard:**

`:%y+`


#### Copy a line without the newline break
`^y$`		

`^` goes to the first character of the line. `y` yanks until	`$` end of line.


#### yank
`yy or Y` – yank the current line, including the newline character at the end of the line
`y$` – yank to the end of the current line (but don't yank the newline character)
`yiw` – yank the current word (excluding surrounding whitespace)
`yaw` – yank the current word (including leading or trailing whitespace)

## Block commenting
First, move the cursor to the first char of the first line in block code you want to comment, then type `CTRL + V`.

Vim will go into VISUAL BLOCK mode. Use `j` to move the cursor down until you reach the last line of your code block. Then type `Shift + I`.

Now vim goes to INSERT mode and the cursor is at the first char of the first line. Finally, type `#` then `ESC` and the code block is now commented.

To decomment, do the same things but instead of typing `Shift + I`, you just type `x` to remove all '#' after highlight them in VISUAL BLOCK mode.


## Find and replace

To find each occurrence of ‘eth0’ in the current line only, and replace it with ‘br0’, enter (first press `Esc` key and type):
`:s/eth0/br0/g`

To find and replace all occurrences of ‘eth1’ with ‘br1’, enter:
`:%s/eth1/br1/g`

To find and replace all occurrences of ‘eth1’ with ‘br1’, but ask for confirmation first, enter:
`:%s/eth1/br1/gc`

To find and replace all occurrences of case insensitive ‘eth1’ with ‘br1’, enter:
`:%s/eth1/br1/gi`


## Windows and splits

#### resize window
Resize window to 30 lines high
`:res 30`

Resize all windows (splits) to equal size
`Ctrl-w =`
